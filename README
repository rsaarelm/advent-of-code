# Polyglot Advent of Code solution collection

Days are encoded by %y%d, 2015-12-18 becomes 1518.

All implementations take the input from stdin and print the two solutions for
the two parts on separate lines of stdout.

Advent of Code is at https://adventofcode.com/

## Writing a new solution

* Save your input in a file named according to the year and the day,
  2018-12-14 becomes `1814.txt`.

* Write your solution using the same naming convention under the directory of
  the language you're using. Details may vary by language. For Python, it's
  just `py/1814.py`.

* The solution receives the input from stdin and is expected to print its
  results for parts 1 and 2 to stdout as two lines.

## Running a solution

Use the Justfile with your language suffix and date, for a Python solution for
2015-12-01, you'd use

    just run py/1501
